# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Two-pane chat with behind-the-scenes monitor
The `/chat` screen SHALL show the conversation in a left pane and a behind-the-scenes monitor in a right pane. On
screens narrower than 1024 px the monitor SHALL stack below the conversation. The monitor SHALL follow the turn that
is streaming, and SHALL switch to a past assistant turn when the user selects it.

#### Scenario: Layout
- **WHEN** a user opens `/chat` on a wide screen
- **THEN** the chat is on the left and the monitor on the right

#### Scenario: Select a past turn
- **WHEN** the user clicks an earlier assistant turn
- **THEN** the monitor loads and shows that turn's stored trace

### Requirement: Monitor views
The monitor SHALL present the turn trace as:
- a timeline of all events with elapsed times and durations;
- a model-calls view showing each request (messages, tools, tool mode) and response (text, tool calls, tokens, latency);
- a retrieval view showing tenant scope, settings, query terms, and dense, sparse and fused candidates with scores and
  rerank order;
- an MCP view with raw arguments and results and the serving replica;
- a prompt and memory view with the system prompt, tool schemas and history window.

Every event's raw data SHALL be expandable.

#### Scenario: Retrieval internals visible
- **WHEN** a turn's search_documents call completes
- **THEN** the retrieval view lists the dense, sparse and fused candidates with chunk ids and scores for that call

#### Scenario: Live timeline
- **WHEN** a turn is streaming
- **THEN** new timeline entries appear as their trace events arrive

### Requirement: Trace from the review queue
The `/admin/feedback` review form SHALL offer the turn's trace to the reviewing FIRM_ADMIN.

#### Scenario: Reviewer opens trace
- **WHEN** a FIRM_ADMIN opens a flagged turn in the review queue
- **THEN** a link or panel shows that turn's trace
